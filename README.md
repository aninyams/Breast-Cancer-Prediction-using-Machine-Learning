The project objective is to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying cells as benign or malignant. 
The models applied are decision trees, random forest, Na√Øve Bayes and KNN. The k-fold Cross-validation method was applied to all models and set to cv=10. 
Accuracy was used to score the models. The dataset used is the Mammographic dataset which is available on UCI machine learning Repository.
